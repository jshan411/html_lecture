      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted
      by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
      languages such as JavaScript.

      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      its appearance.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
      lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
      tags, written using angle brackets.
